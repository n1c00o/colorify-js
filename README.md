# colorify-js

Useless class that allows you to colour your string using ANSI Colors code ðŸ’™

## How to use

Copy the corresponding file *(for js or ts)* in your project. Then, create an instances of the class where you want to use it!
The class is only using 8 colors that the majority of shells supports. *(Sorry if not ðŸ˜­)*
